Hi, I am an **Earth System Scientist** studying sustainable agriculture, air pollution, climate change, and public health using **process-based models** and **observations**.

My research improves models to mathematically describe **natural processes** and **human activities** and to better understand their impacts on air quality, environmental health, and climate. For instance, I have used
* DeNitrification-DeComposition ([DNDC](http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/)) to model crop yields of maize-soybean intercropping;
* [GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/) to estimate aerosol pollution driven by agricultural ammonia emissions, and;
* Community Earth System Model ([CESM](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)) for modeling soil ammonia emission, and marine sulfur aerosols.

I am also interested in **innovative sustainable alternatives** (e.g., intercropping and biofuels) that could minimize our environmental footprints while secure our demands for food and energy.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate in [Prof. Colette Heald's group](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([MIT](https://mit.edu)). I graduated with a Ph.D. in **Earth and Atmospheric Sciences** from [Prof. Amos Tai's group](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/tgabi/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as well as a M.Sc. in **Mathematics** from CUHK, and a B.Eng. in **Mechanical Engineering** from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

Please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:kamingfung@mit.edu) if you would like to know more about my works.
