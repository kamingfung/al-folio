description: about my name and Cantonese
---

"Fung" (馮) is my family name and "Ka Ming" (家銘) is my first name (Yes, two words); both are romanized Cantonese.

In a Chinese name, the family name comes first so my birth name reads "Fung Ka Ming". Since Hong Kong's education system adopts the British model, some Hong Kongers would use additional English names as nicknames (e.g., mine is "Victor").

I choose to use "Ka Ming FUNG" as my professional identity to express my gratitude to my parents for my birth name as well as to promote and preserve Cantonese.
